# Penguin Post

This website showcases skills learned during weeks 7-14 of The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. 

The Penguin Post is a social media website that allows a user to 'Squawk' (share up to 281 characters of information to your friends), favorite Squawks and grow your group of friends to stay engaged with your community.
